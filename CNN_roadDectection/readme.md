for Fun. Please see examples.

There is a problem with cv2.resize(). It cannot resize binary images.

Model learned what is "street" from 250 Boston street pictures. And I tested it for a korea driving video.

The model can recoginize korean street. It proves that streets in the US are similar to the ones in Korea.
