Neural Networks for Atomic Force microscropy Images

If you are only interested in the results, please visit "Best_AFMimages_ReconstructionExamples_weCanCurrentlyAchieve".

For all examples, the left column image is undersampled image with mu-path pattern (which is often used for AFM image sampling), the middle column image is reconstructed image from the left-comlun samples using Deep Neural Network, the right column image is the ground truth.
