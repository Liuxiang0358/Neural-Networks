This is the best mu-path undersampled image reconstruction we can currently achieve using deep neural network. (A slightly improvement needs a large amout of training time and a large increasement of layers when the reconstruction is already very good and acceptable.)

For highly sparse image, Compressive sensing is still better. Maybe we need a sparse reconstruction deep neural network model :)
